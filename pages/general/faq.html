<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

<p class="question">Q: What is DreamSDK?</p>

<p>A: It's a package which contains everything you need to develop for the Sega
Dreamcast on Microsoft Windows. This package is called the <strong>DreamSDK
environment</strong>.</p>

<p class="question">Q: Why another package? Again?</p>

<p>A: Because this one is of course better! More seriously, this package is
different from the others since it includes only absolutely required binaries
plus the two required precompiled toolchains (<span
class="font-fixed">SH-4</span> and <span class="font-fixed">ARM</span>). It
doesn't contains KallistiOS itself, which is handled by <a
href="../manager/index.html" target="_blank">DreamSDK Manager</a>. Doing so
will allow the DreamSDK package and your local installation staying always
up-to-date.</p>

<p class="question">Q: What is KallistiOS?</p>

<p>A: It's the software library which handles the Sega Dreamcast hardware. It's
a great way to develop freely for your Sega Dreamcast. This library is not
included in the DreamSDK package, instead it's handled by the <a
href="../manager/index.html" target="_blank">DreamSDK Manager</a> tool, part of
the DreamSDK environment.</p>

<p class="question">Q: What is KallistiOS Ports?</p>

<p>A: It's a port collection made by the KallistiOS team. Ports are additional
libraries to extend KallistiOS, e.g. adding <span
class="font-fixed">PNG</span>, <span class="font-fixed">JPEG</span> or <span
class="font-fixed">SDL</span> support to your program.</p>

<p class="question">Q: And... what is Dreamcast Tool?</p>

<p>A: It's the program responsible of sending your program to the Dreamcast
through the serial (Coders Cable) cable or via your Broadband/LAN Adapter (if
you have the luck to have one), in order to execute/debug them. Dreamcast Tool,
also called <span class="font-fixed">dc-tool</span>, is the server part. The
Sega Dreamcast part is called <span class="font-fixed">dcload</span>, it exists
in two version, <span class="font-fixed">serial</span> and <span
class="font-fixed">ip</span>.</p>

<p class="question">Q: I found a bug or a missing software. How can I contact
you?</p>

<p>A: Please visit the <a href="http://dreamsdk.sizious.com/"
target="_blank">DreamSDK Website</a> and use the <strong>Contact</strong>
form.</p>

<p class="question">Q: It's really mandatory to use the DreamSDK Shell to build
Dreamcast programs?</p>

<p>A: It's better, but not mandatory. Check the <a href="../shell/index.html"
target="_blank">DreamSDK Shell</a> documentation to learn the possibilities.</p>

<p class="question">Q: Can I use the package with an IDE (Integrated
development environment)?</p>

<p>A: Since all Sega Dreamcast development tools (e.g. toolchains binaries)
have been statically linked, you can use them outside the DreamSDK environment.
This hasn't been tested however. By the way this should be a side project upon
the DreamSDK package!</p>

<p class="question">Q: Can I contribute to the DreamSDK project? The first
thing I want to submit is a fix for that horrible Frenglish!</p>

<p>A: Of course! The project is hosted on <a
href="https://github.com/dreamsdk/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Feel free to
send a <span class="font-fixed">Pull Request</span>!</p>
