<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

<p class="question">Q: What is DreamSDK?</p>

<p>A: It's a package which contains everything you need to develop for the Sega
Dreamcast on Microsoft Windows. This package is called the <strong>DreamSDK
environment</strong>.</p>

<p class="question">Q: What is NOT DreamSDK?</p>

<p>A: It's not a easy-to-use framework like Unity. You will need to learn Sega Dreamcast
programming and especially KallistiOS libraries capabilities. In clear, DreamSDK
is just a ready-to-use environment that allow you to compile/build Sega
Dreamcast programs, but won't help you to learn and/or facilitate Sega Dreamcast programming.</p>

<p class="question">Q: Why another package? Again?</p>

<p>A: Because this one is of course better! More seriously, this package is
different from the others since it includes only absolutely required binaries
plus the two required precompiled toolchains (<span
class="font-fixed">SH-4</span> and <span class="font-fixed">ARM</span>) in
order to build Sega Dreamcast programs. It doesn't contains KallistiOS itself,
which is handled by <a href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK Manager</a>. Doing
so will allow the DreamSDK package and your local installation staying always
up-to-date, without the need of downloading an updated DreamSDK package.</p>

<p class="question">Q: What is a homebrew program?</p>

<p>A: It's a program for your Sega Dreamcast which is made by you. Read <a
target="_blank"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games)">Wikipedia</a> for
more information.</p>

<p class="question">Q: What is an <span class="font-fixed">.elf</span> file?</p>

<p>A: It's the binary format used for programs for the Sega Dreamcast (in our
case). It's the exact equivalent to <span class="font-fixed">.exe</span>
programs on Windows. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format"
target="_blank">Executable Linkable Format</a> (<span
class="font-fixed">.elf</span>) programs made with the DreamSDK environment are
suitable for the Sega Dreamcast.</p>

<p class="question">Q: What is a selfboot (or autoboot/bootable) disc?</p>

<p>A: It's a special disc image format which allow the Sega Dreamcast to run
the software on it, like a real game disc. There is a big vulnerability in the
BIOS code of the Sega Dreamcast, but to summarize, this vulnerability allows
the boot of burned CD-R like genuine discs if these discs are burned in a
special way. This kind of discs are usually called selfboot discs. <a
href="../tutorials/index.html#master">Click here to learn more</a>.</p>

<p class="question">Q: What is an <span class="font-fixed">IP.BIN</span>
file?</p>

<p>A: <span class="font-fixed">IP</span> stands for <strong>Initial
Program</strong>. It's the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping#Software_loading_and_execution"
target="_blank">bootstrap</a> used on <span class="font-fixed">CD-R</span>
images. This little program tell the Sega Dreamcast the name of the boot
program (usually <span class="font-fixed">1ST_READ.BIN</span>, see below) plus
other informations. This file is not in the file system but it's inserted in
the first <span class="font-fixed">CD-R</span> sectors. If you select the <a
href="../addons/index.html#ipcreate">IPCreate</a> program when installing
DreamSDK, you'll be able to generate these kind of files.</p>

<p class="question">Q: What is a <em>scrambled</em> program?</p>

<p>A: Scrambled programs are <span class="font-fixed">.elf</span> programs
which are converted into <span class="font-fixed">1ST_READ.BIN</span> files.
This program binary format is a special format allowing the boot of your
program from a <span class="font-fixed">CD-R</span>. In clear, the <span
class="font-fixed">CD-R</span> making process can be summarized as:</p>

<div class="schema">
<img src="../../img/general/boot.gif"> </div>

<p class="answer-more">Basically, from your source directory, you build the
main binary program by entering the <span class="font-fixed">make</span>
command. Then, you can enter the <span class="font-fixed">make dist</span>
command to generate the raw binary. Then finalize the process by scrambling the
program by just typing <span class="font-fixed">scramble yourprog.bin
1ST_READ.BIN</span>. Now, you just have to generate an <span
class="font-fixed">IP.BIN</span> file and you are good to go: put everything on
a disc image. <a href="../tutorials/index.html#master">The whole process is
described here</a>.</p>

<p class="question">Q: What is KallistiOS?</p>

<p>A: KallistiOS (or <span class="font-fixed">KOS</span>) is the software
library which allows access to the Sega Dreamcast hardware. It's a great way to
develop freely for your Sega Dreamcast. This library is not included in the
DreamSDK package, instead it's handled by the <a
href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK Manager</a> tool, part of the DreamSDK
environment. Basically, KallistiOS will be downloaded by the DreamSDK Manager
tool but it isn't embedded in the DreamSDK Setup program.</p>

<p class="question">Q: What is KallistiOS Ports?</p>

<p>A: It's a port collection made by the KallistiOS team. Ports are additional
libraries to extend KallistiOS, e.g. adding <span
class="font-fixed">PNG</span>, <span class="font-fixed">JPEG</span> or <span
class="font-fixed">SDL</span> support to your program.</p>

<p class="question">Q: And... what is Dreamcast Tool?</p>

<p>A: It's the program responsible of sending your program to the Dreamcast
through the serial (Coders Cable) cable or via your Broadband/LAN Adapter (if
you have the luck to have one), in order to execute/debug them. Dreamcast Tool,
also called <span class="font-fixed">dc-tool</span>, is the server part. The
Sega Dreamcast part is called <span class="font-fixed">dcload</span> and exists
in two version, <span class="font-fixed">serial</span> and <span
class="font-fixed">ip</span>. <a href="../tutorials/index.html#dcload">Click
here to learn everything on it</a>.</p>

<p class="question">Q: It's really mandatory to use the DreamSDK Shell to build
Dreamcast programs?</p>

<p>A: It's better, but not mandatory. Check the <a
href="../runner/index.html">DreamSDK Runner</a> documentation or even better,
<a href="../ide/index.html">use the Code::Blocks IDE</a>.</p>

<p class="question">Q: Can I use the package with an IDE (Integrated
development environment)?</p>

<p>A: Since DreamSDK R2, the environment is fully compatible with Code::Blocks
17.12 stable release. Just install the IDE and select the appropriate option
when installing DreamSDK. Code::Blocks was chosen because it's free,
extensible, open source and nice to use, and even better, it's still compatible
with the old Windows XP. There is no plan to support other IDE yet.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="otherdir"></a>Q: From the DreamSDK Shell, how can
I access to another directory which is NOT in the DreamSDK tree? Is it
mandatory to create my Sega Dreamcast homebrew projects in the DreamSDK
environment, i.e. in my <span class="font-fixed">/home</span> directory from
the DreamSDK environment?</p>

<p>A: No. You can access to all Windows drives by entering something like <span
class="font-fixed">cd
/&lt;drive_letter&gt;/&lt;my_folder1&gt;/&lt;my_folder2&gt;/</span>, e.g. <span
class="font-fixed">cd /C/Dreamcast/My/Project/</span>, or <a
href="../shell/overview.html#opendir">you can just pass the directory to
open</a> to the <span class="font-fixed">dreamsdk.exe</span> binary.</p>

<p class="question">Q: How can I test all the environment? Is there any way to
test if everything is working correctly in my environment?</p>

<p>A: Yes. The simplest way to check that everything is working is compiling
all KallistiOS samples. But before that, <a
href="../manager/kos-ports.html">you have to install all KallistiOS Ports</a>.
After that, just type <span class="font-fixed">cd
/opt/toolchains/dc/kos/examples/</span> then enter <span
class="font-fixed">make</span>. All examples should compile fine, and all <span
class="font-fixed">.elf</span> programs will be generated. But really, it
should be not necessary to do that, plus, the generation time is really
long.</p>

<p class="question">Q: I found a bug or a missing software. How can I contact
you?</p>

<p>A: Please visit the <a href="https://www.dreamsdk.org/"
target="_blank">DreamSDK Website</a> or even better, <a
href="http://dcemulation.org/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=29" target="_blank">you can
post your issue on the official KallistiOS forum</a>.</p>

<p class="question">Q: Can I contribute to the DreamSDK project? The first
thing I want to submit is a fix for that horrible Frenglish!</p>

<p>A: Of course! The project is hosted on <a
href="https://github.com/dreamsdk/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Feel free to
send a <span class="font-fixed">Pull Request</span>! <a href="contribute.html">Click here to learn
details on that topic</a>.</p>
