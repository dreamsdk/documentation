<h1>Features</h1>

<p><strong>DreamSDK</strong> is a very different environment for Sega Dreamcast
development, counter to the previous release packages of this kind:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Easy to install:</strong> Just double-click on the setup file and
    let the program install &amp; configure everything for you.</li>
  <li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Thanks to the <a href="http://mingw.org/"
    target="_blank">MinGW/MSYS</a> environment, the environment is really
    smaller in size instead of <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/"
    target="_blank">Cygwin</a> (the other alternative for <em>UNIX®</em> like
    environment on <strong>Windows</strong>).</li>
  <li><strong>Fast:</strong> All the toolchains (which are really long to
    build, almost 8 hours!) are already prebuilt and ready-to-use.</li>
  <li><strong>Configurable and upgradable:</strong> With the <a
    href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK Manager</a> tool, install or update
    the <strong>KallistiOS</strong> (<span class="code">KOS</span>) library
    really easily. Handles <strong>KallistiOS Ports</strong> through an
    user-friendly application, and configure <strong>Dreamcast Tool</strong> as
    you want.</li>
  <li><strong>Respect of the KallistiOS standard:</strong> This environment is
    100% compliant with the KOS standard, i.e. the KOS documentation applies at
    100% to this environment. No major specific hacks or dirty workaround are
    needed (the only exception is the <span class="code">ln</span> tool, which
    is not working properly on <a href="http://mingw.org/"
    target="_blank">MinGW/MSYS</a> but this is a really minor drawback and it's
    already handled by <a href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK
  Manager</a>).</li>
</ul>
