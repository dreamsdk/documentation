<H1>Features</H1>

<ul>
<li><b>Easy to install:</b> Just double-click on the setup file and let the program configure everything for you.</li>
<li><b>Lightweight:</b> Thanks to the MinGW/MSYS environment, the environment is really smaller in size instead of Cygwin.</li>
<li><b>Fast:</b> All the tool-chains, which are really long to build (about 8 hours!) are already pre-compiled and ready-to-use.</li>
<li><b>Configurable and upgradable:</b> With the <a href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK Manager</a> tool, install or update the <b>KallistiOS</b> library really easily. Handles <b>KallistiOS Ports</b> through an user-friendly application, and configure <b>Dreamcast Tool</b> at the same time.</li>
<li><b>IDE Compatible:</b> As all tool-chains executables were built statically, they can be run outside the MinGW/MSYS environment so they can be used on IDE environments.</li>
</ul>
