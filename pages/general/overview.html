<h1>DreamSDK Overview</h1>

<p><strong>DreamSDK is a modern, ready-to-use environment for Sega Dreamcast
development, designed for the Microsoft Windows platform.</strong></p>

<p>It's a big, self-contained package embedding all needed software to freely
develop for the Sega Dreamcast system on Windows. This package is built on
open-source software only thus it doesn't contains any copyrighted software.
See <a href="licenses.html">the licenses section</a> for more information.</p>

<p>In clear, DreamSDK provides you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An UNIX® like environment;</li>
  <li>Three prebuilt toolchains;</li>
  <li>Some side utilities in order to manage the whole environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the sub-sections below describes in details the environment
composition:</p>

<h2><a name="arch">Architecture summary</a></h2>

<p>As described in the introduction, <strong>DreamSDK is a package which is
built upon a lot of components</strong>.</p>

<p>The schema below describes the architecture of the whole environment:</p>

<div class="schema">
<img src="../../img/general/overview.gif"> </div>

<h2><a name="mingw">MinGW/MSYS</a></h2>

<p>The UNIX® like environment is provided by <a
href="http://mingw.org/" target="_blank">MinGW/MSYS</a>. Basically this is the
environment base, which provides UNIX® tools on Windows.</p>

<p>Everything is built upon this middleware.</p>

<h2><a name="shell">DreamSDK Shell</a></h2>

<p><a href="../shell/index.html">DreamSDK Shell</a> is a component built on the
top of <strong>MSYS</strong>. Basically, this is the main program of this
environment.</p>

<h2><a name="tool">Toolchains</a></h2>

<p>The toolchains are basically the set of the tools needed to produces your
programs, i.e. compiling programs and debugging them. In our case, these
toolchains are used to compile and build binary code targeting the Sega
Dreamcast.</p>

<p>Three toolchains are provided by the DreamSDK environment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For the <strong>SuperH CPU</strong> processor (<span
    class="font-fixed">sh-elf</span>), the main processor of the Sega
  Dreamcast;</li>
  <li>For the <strong>Yamaha AICA</strong> processor (<span
    class="font-fixed">arm-eabi</span>), the sound processor. You don't have to
    use it directly, as this is needed only to compile the sound driver
    included in KallistiOS (see below).</li>
  <li>The last one is the original <strong>Win32</strong> toolchain (<span
    class="font-fixed">mingw32</span>) provided by MinGW/MSYS, this allow you
    to produces Windows binaries, e.g. compiling KallistiOS utilities like
    <span class="font-fixed">vqenc</span>, <span
    class="font-fixed">scramble</span>, <span
    class="font-fixed">dc-tool</span>... But, you have the possibility to
    develop pure Windows binaries as well for other purposes if you need
  to.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the toolchains are assembled from several components:<a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/" target="_blank"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/"
    target="_blank">Binutils</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_blank">GNU Compiler
    Collection</a> (GCC)</li>
  <li><a href="http://sourceware.org/newlib/" target="_blank">Newlib</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/" target="_blank">GNU
    Debugger</a> (GDB)</li>
</ul>

<p>These components are already prebuilt and installed with the DreamSDK
environment.</p>

<h2><a name="kos">KallistiOS</a></h2>

<p><strong>KallistiOS provides you a ready-to-use software library to interact
with the Sega Dreamcast hardware</strong>. This facilitates a lot the
development, instead of writing low-level code to access the Sega Dreamcast
hardware: everything is already done by this library.</p>

<p>That's why DreamSDK uses <a
href="http://cadcdev.sourceforge.net/softprj/kos/"
target="_blank">KallistiOS</a> (<span class="font-fixed">KOS)</span>, which is
the best option today for Sega Dreamcast development. By the way, it has been
used to produce multiple commercial quality games for sale, like <strong>Feet
of Fury</strong>, <strong>Maqiupai</strong>, <strong>Inhabitants</strong>,
<strong>Cool Herders</strong>, <strong>Dynamite Dreams</strong> and many more.
DreamSDK respects all the standard <span class="font-fixed">KOS</span>
prerequisites and requirements, that means this environment is 100% compliant
with KallistiOS.</p>

<h3><a name="kosports">KallistiOS Ports</a></h3>

<p>KallistiOS Ports are ports collection made by the KallistiOS team. Ports are
additional libraries used to extend the features of KallistiOS, like e.g.
adding support for <span class="font-fixed">PNG</span>, <span
class="font-fixed">JPEG</span> or <span class="font-fixed">SDL</span> to your
program.</p>

<h3><a name="dctool">Dreamcast Tool</a></h3>

<p>Dreamcast Tool, or <span class="font-fixed">dc-tool</span>, is the tool used
to send your programs to the Sega Dreamcast in order to execute and debug
them.</p>

<p>This program is split in two parts, <span class="font-fixed">dcload</span>
for the server part (executed on the Sega Dreamcast) and <span
class="font-fixed">dc-tool</span> for the client part (executed from your
computer).</p>

<p>Depending of your connection kind, you have to use the correct program
version:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you own the <strong>Serial</strong> cable (aka the Coders Cable), the
    version to use is <span class="font-fixed">dcload-serial</span>;</li>
  <li>If you have the luck owning an expensive <strong>Broadband
    Adapter</strong> or even the <strong>LAN Adapter</strong>, which are
    Ethernet cards for the Sega Dreamcast, you will have to use the <span
    class="font-fixed">dcload-ip</span> version.</li>
</ul>

<p>This component is disabled by default, as you have the possibility to
execute your programs directly through a Dreamcast emulator, i.e. using <span
class="font-fixed">nullDC</span>, <span class="font-fixed">Demul</span>, <span
class="font-fixed">Makaron</span>, etc.</p>

<h3><a name="managekos">Managing KallistiOS with DreamSDK environment</a></h3>

<p>Instead of the majority of previous released packages of this kind (e.g.
<span class="font-fixed">dcfreedev</span> — with that really out-dated <span
class="font-fixed">GCC 3.4.6</span> —, <span class="font-fixed">DC Dev
Environment</span> (DDE), <span class="font-fixed">Code::Blocks DC
Development</span>...), <strong>DreamSDK only includes the prebuilt
toolchains</strong> <strong>but not the KallistiOS library itself</strong>:
KallistiOS is handled by the <a href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK
Manager</a> application.</p>

<p>This is the reason why DreamSDK ask you to be connected to Internet when
installing it: <span class="font-fixed">KOS</span> is installed automatically
at the end of the installation process. If you have cancelled the process or
the process has failed, just fire-up <a href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK
Manager</a> again and that application will (re)install <span
class="font-fixed">KOS</span> if needed.</p>

<h3><a name="kosalt">Alternatives to KallistiOS</a></h3>

<p>As you saw, <strong>DreamSDK uses KallistiOS</strong>, as this software
library is the most advanced library for Sega Dreamcast development. </p>

<p>The other alternative to <span class="font-fixed">KOS</span> is <a
target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/ihi/libronin">Libronin</a>. This
software library was used for making <a href="http://mc.pp.se/dc/dreamsnes/"
target="_blank">DreamSNES</a>. It should work under DreamSDK, even if this
scenario was not tested.</p>

<p>You are free to use other libraries if you want, but KOS is a great choice
if you are new to Dreamcast development.</p>

<h2><a name="mgr">DreamSDK Manager</a></h2>

<p><a href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK Manager</a> is the
application which handle everything of the DreamSDK environment. Basically this
application was made to update KallistiOS but it can also handle KallistiOS
Ports even Dreamcast Tool configuration.</p>
