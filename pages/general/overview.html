<H1>DreamSDK Overview</H1>

<p><b>DreamSDK</b> is a ready-to-use environment for <b>Sega Dreamcast</b> development running on the <b>Microsoft Windows</b> platform.</p>

<p>It's a self-contained package embedding all needed software to freely develop for the <b>Sega Dreamcast</b> system on Windows. This package is built on open-source software only thus it doesn't contains any copyrighted software. See <a href="licenses.html">licenses</a> for more information.</p>

<p><b>DreamSDK</b> is composed by several components, mainly:</p>
<ul>
	<li>MinGW/MSYS for the core system and foundation;</li>
	<li>Binutils, GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), Newlib and GNU Debugger (GDB) for all the toolchains;</li>
	<li>Additional components made specially for this package:
		<ul>
			<li>DreamSDK Manager, which handles the <b>KallistiOS</b> library;</li>
			<li>DreamSDK Shell, a component which is built on the top of MSYS.</li>	
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><b>DreamSDK</b> uses <b>KallistiOS</b> (KOS), which is the best option today to develop for the Dreamcast. It's a pro-grade development system for the Dreamcast. KOS has been used to produce multiple commercial quality games for sale like Feet of Fury.</p>

<p>Instead of the majority of the previous released packages of this kind (e.g. <b>dcfreedev</b> &mdash; with GCC 3.4.6 &mdash;, <b>DC Dev Environment (DDE)</b>, <b>Code::Blocks DC Development</b>...), this package only includes the pre-compiled toolchains (both for the <b>SuperH</b> CPU and <b>Yamaha AICA</b>) but not the <b>KallistiOS</b> library itself: <b>KallistiOS</b> is handled by the <b>DreamSDK Manager</b> application.</p>

<p>The whole package is built and optimized for Windows. It respects the KallistiOS requirements and prerequisites, which means that you'll need to compile your Dreamcast programs from the DreamSDK Shell.</p>

<p>This environment should work with <a target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/ihi/libronin">Libronin</a> too, the only other viable alternative for the Dreamcast development but this scenario was not tested.</p>
