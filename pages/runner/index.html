<h1>DreamSDK Runner</h1>

<p><strong>DreamSDK Runner is an interesting component as it allows usage of
the DreamSDK environment outside it!</strong></p>

<p>Select a chapter below to learn how to use this component:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#overview">Overview</a></li>
  <li><a href="#limit">Limitation</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>With this component, you have the possibility to execute commands inside the
MSYS Shell without actually opening it.</p>

<p>This component is used internally by the <a
href="../ide/index.html">Code::Blocks integration</a> but it can be useful for
you as well: supposing your homebrew program directory is located in <span
class="font-fixed">D:\Dreamcast\MyProgram\</span> and you are using a standard
KallistiOS <span class="font-fixed">Makefile</span> structure (i.e. look to the
<span class="font-fixed">/opt/toolchains/dc/kos/examples/dreamcast/</span>
directory for templates).</p>

<p>Create a new batch file in that <span
class="font-fixed">D:\Dreamcast\MyProgram\</span> directory and call it <span
class="font-fixed">build.cmd</span>. Copy this content on it:</p>

<div class="fixed-block">
@echo off<br>
title Build<br>
dreamsdk-runner "make"<br>
pause<br>
</div>

<p>Now, double-click to run it: <strong>You will have your program
built</strong>, exactly if you had manually entered that <span
class="font-fixed">make</span> command in the MSYS Shell!</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="../../img/runner/runner1.png"> </div>

<p><strong>Of course, this will work only if you have added DreamSDK in your
<span class="font-fixed">PATH</span> variable at the installation! </strong>If
you have not updated the <span class="font-fixed">PATH</span> variable, you
will need to put the full path to the <span
class="font-fixed">dreamsdk-runner</span> binary, i.e. <span
class="font-fixed">%DREAMSDK_HOME%\msys\1.0\opt\dreamsdk\dreamsdk-runner.exe</span>.</p>

<p>Now, you can even do the same for the clean target of your <span
class="font-fixed">Makefile</span>, by creating a <span
class="font-fixed">clean.cmd</span> file and putting this content on it:</p>

<div class="fixed-block">
@echo off<br>
title Clean<br>
dreamsdk-runner "make clean"<br>
pause<br>
</div>

<p>So the result will be:</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="../../img/runner/runner2.png"></div>

<p>Double-click on that <span class="font-fixed">clean.cmd</span> batch file in
your <span class="font-fixed">D:\Dreamcast\MyProgram\</span> directory to
execute the <span class="font-fixed">make clean</span> command directly on the
current directory, where that script is located.</p>

<p>Of course you can pass any command to the DreamSDK Runner, but usually, it's
a great feature used only for <span class="font-fixed">make</span> commands.</p>

<p>You have the possibility to process the output of the DreamSDK Runner by
catching it with redirections.</p>

<h2><a name="limit">Limitation</a></h2>

<p>Only one command can be executed at once so passing commands like <span
class="font-fixed">make clean &amp;&amp; echo "YESS"</span> <strong>will not
work</strong>. In that case, you just have to execute two commands by executing
the Runner twice.</p>
