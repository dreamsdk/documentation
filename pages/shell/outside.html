<h1>Windows Integration</h1>

<p><strong>DreamSDK Shell is an interesting component as it allows usage of the
DreamSDK environment outside it!</strong></p>

<p>With this component, you have the possibility to execute commands inside the
MSYS Shell without actually opening it.</p>

<p>Supposing your homebrew program directory is located in <span
class="font-fixed">D:\Dreamcast\MyProgram\</span> and you are using a standard
KallistiOS <span class="font-fixed">Makefile</span> structure (i.e. look to the
<span class="font-fixed">/opt/toolchains/dc/kos/examples/dreamcast/</span>
directory for templates).</p>

<p>Create a new batch file in that <span
class="font-fixed">D:\Dreamcast\MyProgram\</span> directory and call it <span
class="font-fixed">build.cmd</span>. Copy this content on it:</p>

<div class="fixed-block">
@dreamsdk "make"</div>

<p>Now, double-click to run it: <strong>You will have your program
built</strong>, exactly if you had manually entered that <span
class="font-fixed">make</span> command in the MSYS Shell!</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="../../img/shell/outside2.png"> </div>

<p><strong>Of course, this will work only if you have added DreamSDK in your
<span class="font-fixed">PATH</span> variable at the installation! </strong>If
you have not updated the PATH variable, you will need to put the full path to
the dreamsdk binary, e.g. <span
class="font-fixed">${DREAMSDK_HOME}\msys\1.0\opt\dreamsdk\dreamsdk.exe</span>.</p>

<p>Now, you can even do the same for the clean target of your <span
class="font-fixed">Makefile</span>, by creating a <span
class="font-fixed">clean.cmd</span> file and putting this content on it:</p>

<div class="fixed-block">
@dreamsdk "make clean"</div>

<p>So the result will be:</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="../../img/shell/outside1.png"></div>

<p>Double-click on that <span class="font-fixed">clean.cmd</span> batch file in
your <span class="font-fixed">D:\Dreamcast\MyProgram\</span> directory to
execute the <span class="font-fixed">make clean</span> command directly on the
current directory, where that script is located.</p>

<p>Of course you can pass any command to the DreamSDK Shell, but usually, it's
a great feature used only for <span class="font-fixed">make</span> commands.</p>
