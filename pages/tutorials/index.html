<h2><a name="master">How to release your Sega Dreamcast program</a></h2>

<p>So after finishing the development of your Sega Dreamcast project (well done!) comes the following question: <strong>How to release your Sega Dreamcast program?</strong></p>
<p>This is a good question and unfortunatelly, the KallistiOS library won't help you much, but as you are using DreamSDK, the answer is detailed here!</p>
<p>Before starting reading this section, you should be aware of <span class="font-fixed">ELF</span>, <em>unscrambled</em> and <em>scrambled</em> files, this is explained in the <a href="../general/faq.html">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing to know is there is 3 ways to package a Sega Dreamcast program:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#plain">Plain files</a></li>
      <li><a href="#selfboot">Selfboot disc image</a></li>
  <li><a href="#sbi">Selfboot Inducer (SBI) packages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The package kind will depends of your needs. Below you'll find an explanation of each kind.</p>
<h3><a name="plain">Plain files</a></h3>
<p><strong>Plain files</strong> is the simplest form of packaging. Basically, it just a <span class="font-fixed">Zip</span> (or any other compressed format) file which contains the raw binary and required files of your program (such textures images, etc.).</p>
<p>This package kind will usually contains an <span class="font-fixed">ELF</span> program (e.g. <span class="font-fixed">hello.elf</span>), a raw unscrambled binary (e.g. <span class="font-fixed">hello.bin</span>) and/or a scrambled binary (usually <span class="font-fixed">1ST_READ.BIN</span>). The end-user will deal with your files himself, i.e. using them as-is (through Sega Dreamcast emulator which have binary support, like nullDC) or making a selfboot disc image (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Plain files</strong> are good for emulators or any other program that should be customized by the end-user, such adding ROM files, music (MP3, Ogg...) files, etc. But in that case, you should write a little <span class="font-fixed">README</span> file to teach the end-user how to use your program... basically, the content of the next chapter!</p>
<p>Of course, your  program should be compiled/built in <span class="font-fixed">Release</span> mode (if using <a href="../ide/index.html">Code::Blocks</a>) and, very important, <strong>without</strong> the <span class="font-fixed">gdb_init()</span> call!</p>
<h3><a name="selfboot">Selfboot disc image</a></h3>
<p><strong>Selfboot disc image</strong> (also known as <strong>Autoboot</strong> disc image) is the most common form of packaging and should be the one you are looking for. This form is basically a disc image, in <strong>Padus DiscJuggler</strong> (<span class="font-fixed">CDI</span>) or <strong>Alcohol 120%</strong> (<span class="font-fixed">MDS/MDF</span>), which may be burnt on a blank CD-R and startup like a genuine GD-ROM on any (almost) Sega Dreamcast hardware.</p>
<p>DreamSDK includes everything to make these kind of packages.</p>
<p>xxxx</p>
<h3><a name="sbi">Selfboot Inducer (SBI) packages</a></h3>
<p>The third form is called Selfboot Inducer (SBI) packages. It's a special format made for putting several programs on the same CD. A menu is shown when this kind of disc is booted from the Sega Dreamcast, this menu is called DreamInducer.</p>
<p>To generate SBI packages, you will use SBI Builder. to use these packages in order to make a disc, the end-user will need Selfboot Inducer.</p>
<p>These tools aren't part of the DreamSDK package, but <a href="http://sizious.com/" target="_blank">you can find them here</a>.</p>
