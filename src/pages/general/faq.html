<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

<p class="question"><a name="q01">Q: What is DreamSDK?</a></p>

<p>A: It's a package which contains everything you need to develop for the Sega
Dreamcast on Microsoft Windows. This package is called the <strong>DreamSDK
environment</strong>.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q02">Q: What is NOT DreamSDK?</a></p>

<p>A: It's not a easy-to-use framework like Unity / Unreal Engine / whatever.
You will need to learn Sega Dreamcast programming and especially KallistiOS
libraries capabilities. And you should be good in C/C++ programming at least
(Objective-C, Objective C++ is also supported). In clear, DreamSDK is just a
ready-to-use environment that allow you to compile/build Sega Dreamcast
programs, but won't help you to learn and/or facilitate Sega Dreamcast
programming.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q03">Q: Why another package? Again?</a></p>

<p>A: Because this one is of course better! More seriously, this package is
different from the others since it includes only absolutely required binaries
plus the two required precompiled toolchains (<span
class="font-fixed">SH-4</span> and <span class="font-fixed">ARM</span>) in
order to build Sega Dreamcast programs. It doesn't contains KallistiOS itself,
which is handled by <a href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK Manager</a>. Doing
so will allow the DreamSDK package and your local installation staying always
up-to-date, without the need of downloading an updated DreamSDK package.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q04">Q: Can I use DreamSDK on another OS than Windows, e.g.
Linux/Unix/macOS/whatever?</a></p>

<p>A: Short answer: No. This package is intended only for Microsoft Windows
users which they haven't natively a Unix-like Shell, which isn't the case of
the others OS. Please note, starting from Windows 10, <a target="_blank"
href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Windows
Subsystem for Linux</a> is available so it may be an alternative to the
DreamSDK package if you are capable of dealing with toolchains and KallistiOS
yourself.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q05">Q: What is a homebrew program?</a></p>

<p>A: It's a program for your Sega Dreamcast which is made by you. Read <a
target="_blank"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games)">Wikipedia</a> for
more information.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q06">Q: What is an <span class="font-fixed">.elf</span> file?</a></p>

<p>A: It's the binary format used for programs for the Sega Dreamcast (in our
case). It's the exact equivalent to <span class="font-fixed">.exe</span>
programs on Windows. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format"
target="_blank">Executable Linkable Format</a> (<span
class="font-fixed">.elf</span>) programs made with the DreamSDK environment are
suitable for the Sega Dreamcast.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q07">Q: What programming language I should use for
programming?</a></p>

<p>A: You should be a good programmer in <strong>C or C++</strong> languages.
Objective-C and Objective-C++ is also supported but not so used. <a
href="https://dreamcast.wiki/Using_Ruby_for_Sega_Dreamcast_development"
target="_blank">You have the possibility to use Ruby too but this is very
experimental</a>. Of course, you may do some Hitachi SH-4 assembly too if you
are good to learn assembly.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q08">Q: What is the main CPU of the Sega Dreamcast? I'm
interested about doing some assembly!</a></p>

<p>A: It's a Hitachi SH-4 model SH7091, which is virtually identical to the
Renesas SH7750 series of SH4 CPUs. So you may learn SH7091/SH7750 assembly code
if you want to.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q09">Q: What compiler I should use to develop for the Sega
Dreamcast VMU / VMS (Visual Memory Unit / Visual Memory System)?</a></p>

<p>A: The VMU / VMS is the memory card system for the Dreamcast. Unfortunately
DreamSDK doesn't provide anything for the Dreamcast VMU / VMS development.
Plus, the <em>Potato</em> CPU is a very obscure / undocumented CPU. If you
really want to develop VMU programs, then it's better to use the <strong>ARM
Cortex-M23 </strong><strong>emulator</strong> provided by <a
href="https://dmitry.gr" target="_blank">Dmitry Grinberg</a>. <a
href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=25.%20VMU%20Hacking"
target="_blank">Read more here</a>.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="selfboot">Q: What is a selfboot (or autoboot/bootable) disc?</a></p>

<p>A: It's a special disc image format which allow the Sega Dreamcast to run
the software on it, like a real game disc. There is a big vulnerability in the
BIOS code of the Sega Dreamcast, but to summarize, this vulnerability allows
the boot of burned CD-R like genuine discs if these discs are burned in a
special way. This kind of discs are usually called selfboot discs. <a
href="../tutorials/index.html#master">Click here to learn more</a>.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q11">Q: What is an <span class="font-fixed">IP.BIN</span>
file?</a></p>

<p>A: <span class="font-fixed">IP</span> stands for <strong>Initial
Program</strong>. It's the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping#Software_loading_and_execution"
target="_blank">bootstrap</a> used on <span class="font-fixed">CD-R</span>
images. This little program tell the Sega Dreamcast the name of the boot
program (usually <span class="font-fixed">1ST_READ.BIN</span>, see below) plus
other informations. This file is not in the file system but it's inserted in
the first <span class="font-fixed">CD-R</span> sectors. The IP creator (<span
class="font-fixed">makeip</span>) program included in KallistiOS let you
generate these kind of files.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="scrambled">Q: What is a <em>scrambled</em> program?</a></p>

<p>A: Scrambled programs are <span class="font-fixed">.elf</span> programs
which are converted into <span class="font-fixed">1ST_READ.BIN</span> files.
This program binary format is a special format allowing the boot of your
program from a <span class="font-fixed">CD-R</span>. In clear, the <span
class="font-fixed">CD-R</span> making process can be summarized as:</p>

<div class="schema">
<img src="../../img/general/boot.gif"> </div>

<p class="answer-more">Basically, from your source directory, you build the
main binary program by entering the <span class="font-fixed">make</span>
command. Then, you can enter the <span class="font-fixed">make dist</span>
command to generate the raw binary. Then finalize the process by scrambling the
program by just typing <span class="font-fixed">scramble yourprog.bin
1ST_READ.BIN</span>. Now, you just have to generate an <span
class="font-fixed">IP.BIN</span> file and you are good to go: put everything on
a disc image. <a href="../tutorials/index.html#master">The whole process is
described here</a>.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q13">Q: What is KallistiOS?</a></p>

<p>A: KallistiOS (or <span class="font-fixed">KOS</span>) is the software
library which allows access to the Sega Dreamcast hardware. It's a great way to
develop freely for your Sega Dreamcast. This library is not included in the
DreamSDK package, instead it's handled by the <a
href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK Manager</a> tool, part of the DreamSDK
environment. Basically, KallistiOS will be downloaded by the DreamSDK Manager
tool but it isn't embedded in the DreamSDK Setup program.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q14">Q: What is KallistiOS Ports?</a></p>

<p>A: It's a port collection made by the KallistiOS team. Ports are additional
libraries to extend KallistiOS, e.g. adding <span
class="font-fixed">PNG</span>, <span class="font-fixed">JPEG</span> or <span
class="font-fixed">SDL</span> support to your program.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q15">Q: And... what is Dreamcast Tool?</a></p>

<p>A: It's the program responsible of sending your program to the Dreamcast
through the serial (Coders Cable) cable or via your Broadband/LAN Adapter (if
you have the luck to have one), in order to execute/debug them. Dreamcast Tool,
also called <span class="font-fixed">dc-tool</span>, is the server part. The
Sega Dreamcast part is called <span class="font-fixed">dcload</span> and exists
in two version, <span class="font-fixed">serial</span> and <span
class="font-fixed">ip</span>. <a href="../tutorials/index.html#dcload">Click
here to learn everything on it</a>.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q16">Q: Is it really mandatory to use a Coders Cable, a LAN or
Broadband Adapter in order to debug Sega Dreamcast programs?</a></p>

<p>A: No. The <a target="_blank" href="https://redream.io/">Redream</a>
emulator provides a GDB connector. However, this possibility isn't covered by
the DreamSDK package. <a target="_blank"
href="https://libraries.io/github/inolen/redream#debugging">Learn more about
this here</a>.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q17">Q: Is it really mandatory to use the DreamSDK Shell to
build Dreamcast programs?</a></p>

<p>A: It's better, but not mandatory. Check the <a
href="../runner/index.html">DreamSDK Runner</a> documentation or even better,
<a href="../ide/index.html">use the Code::Blocks IDE</a>.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q18">Q: Can I use the package with an IDE (Integrated
development environment)?</a></p>

<p>A: Since DreamSDK R2, the environment <strong>is fully compatible with
Code::Blocks 17.12 or 20.03 stable releases</strong>. Just install the IDE and select the
appropriate option when installing DreamSDK. Code::Blocks was chosen because
it's free, extensible, open source and nice to use, and even better, it's still
compatible with the old Windows XP.</p>

<p>Please note, <strong>only Code::Blocks 17.12 and 20.03 are supported</strong> at least
for now.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="otherdir">Q: From the DreamSDK Shell, how can
I access to another directory which is NOT in the DreamSDK tree?</a> Is it
mandatory to create my Sega Dreamcast homebrew projects in the DreamSDK
environment, i.e. in my <span class="font-fixed">/home</span> directory from
the DreamSDK environment?</p>

<p>A: No it isn't mandatory. You can access to all Windows drives by entering
something like <span class="font-fixed">cd
/&lt;drive_letter&gt;/&lt;my_folder1&gt;/&lt;my_folder2&gt;/</span>, e.g. <span
class="font-fixed">cd /C/Dreamcast/My/Project/</span>, or <a
href="../shell/overview.html#opendir">you can just pass the directory to
open</a> to the <span class="font-fixed">dreamsdk-shell.exe</span> binary.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q21">Q: How can I test all the environment? Is there any way to
test if everything is working correctly in my environment?</a></p>

<p>A: Yes. The simplest way to check that everything is working is compiling
all KallistiOS samples. But before that, <a
href="../manager/kos-ports.html">you have to install all KallistiOS Ports</a>.
After that, just type <span class="font-fixed">cd
/opt/toolchains/dc/kos/examples/</span> then enter <span
class="font-fixed">make</span>. All examples should compile fine, and all <span
class="font-fixed">.elf</span> programs will be generated. But really, it
should be not necessary to do that, plus, the generation time is really
long.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q22">Q: I found a bug or a missing software. How can I contact
you?</a></p>

<p>A: Please visit the <a href="https://www.dreamsdk.org/"
target="_blank">DreamSDK Website</a> or even better, <a
href="http://dcemulation.org/phpBB/viewforum.php?f=29" target="_blank">you can
post your issue on the official KallistiOS forum</a>.</p>

<p class="question"><a name="q23">Q: Can I contribute to the DreamSDK project? The first
thing I want to submit is a fix for that horrible Frenglish!</a></p>

<p>A: Of course! The project is hosted on <a
href="https://github.com/dreamsdk/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Feel free to
send a <span class="font-fixed">Pull Request</span>! <a
href="contribute.html">Click here to learn details on that topic</a>.</p>
