<h1>Features</h1>

<p>DreamSDK is <strong>a very different environment</strong> for the Sega
Dreamcast development in comparison of previous released packages of this
kind:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fast and easy to install:</strong> Just double-click on the setup
    file and let the program install &amp; configure everything for you.</li>
  <li><strong>Lightweight:</strong> Thanks to the <a href="https://mingw.osdn.io/"
    target="_blank">MinGW/MSYS</a> environment, this environment is really
    smaller in disk size instead of competitors solutions like <a
    href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a> (the other
    alternative for UNIX® like environment on Windows).</li>
  <li><strong>Ready to use:</strong> All the toolchains (which are really long
    to build, almost 8 hours!) are already prebuilt and ready-to-use.</li>
  <li><strong>Configurable and upgradable:</strong> With the <a
    href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK Manager</a> tool, install or update
    the KallistiOS (<span class="font-fixed">KOS</span>) library really easily.
    Handle KallistiOS Ports through that user-friendly application, and
    configure Dreamcast Tool to fit your needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Respect of the KallistiOS standards configuration and
    documentation:</strong> This environment is 100% compliant with the <span
    class="font-fixed">KOS</span> standards and documentation. No major
    specific hacks or dirty workaround have been done (the only exception is
    the <span class="font-fixed">ln</span> tool, which is not working properly
    on <a href="https://mingw.osdn.io/" target="_blank">MinGW/MSYS</a> but this is a
    really minor drawback and it's already handled by <a
    href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK Manager</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>DreamSDK is a nice way to develop for the Sega Dreamcast on Windows!</p>
