<h1>Changes Log</h1>

<p>This section describes all releases and notable changes made to the DreamSDK
environment.</p>

<h2>R3 — 2020-02-DD</h2>

<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Some useful links were added in the <strong>Windows Start</strong>
  menu.</li>
  <li>Support of <strong>CDFS</strong> images in <strong>Code::Blocks</strong>:
    You have now the possibility to simulate a virtual <strong>CD-ROM</strong>
    through an <strong>ISO</strong> file, when selecting the appropriate option
    when creating a project in <strong>Code::Blocks</strong>.</li>
  <li>Support for <span class="font-fixed">libkosfat</span> addon library.</li>
  <li>You have now the possibility to manage <strong>Code::Blocks</strong> in
    <strong>DreamSDK Manager</strong>. </li>
  <li>This <strong>CHANGELOG</strong> file to hopefully serve as an evolving
    example of a standardized open source project
  <strong>CHANGELOG</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improved</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An offline version of <strong>KallistiOS</strong>, <strong>KallistiOS
    Ports</strong> and <strong>Dreamcast Tool</strong> are now integrated in
    the package. But it's strongly recommanded to use the online
  repositories!</li>
  <li>Better handling of prerequisites: <strong>Git</strong>,
    <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Subversion Client (SVN)</strong> are
    not mandatory in all the cases, this depends now of your choice.
    <strong>Git</strong> is mandatory only if you use online repositories,
    <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Subversion Client</strong> are always
    optional but preferred if you have the possibility to install these.</li>
  <li>When installing <strong>Code::Blocks</strong>, the process of updating
    user's configuration files is better. Now the <strong>Setup</strong>
    process detects all usable configuration files and patch them if
  possible.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>DreamSDK Manager</strong> tool, URL for the
    <strong>Git</strong> repositories may be changed.</li>
  <li>Better support for <strong>ARP</strong> (creation of the tool
    <strong>FastARP</strong>). It uses the classic <span
    class="font-fixed">arp</span> command in <strong>Windows XP</strong> and
    <span class="font-fixed">netsh</span> in modern
  <strong>Windows</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>MakeDisc</strong>: The <span class="font-fixed">bootstrap</span>
    parameter is now optional. It will try to detect the <span
    class="font-fixed">IP.BIN</span> from the current directory or directly in
    the directory where the <span class="font-fixed">1ST_READ.BIN</span> file
    is located.</li>
  <li>The installation of <strong>GNU Debugger (GDB) for SuperH</strong> is
    better; and <strong>Python</strong> extensions may be enabled/disabled on
    user request (previously, <strong>GDB for SuperH</strong> was linked to
    <strong>Python 2.7</strong> only).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>KallistiOS</strong>, <strong>KallistiOS Ports</strong> and
    <strong>Dreamcast Tool</strong> repositories are now the
    <strong>Nitro</strong> versions from <a target="_blank"
    href="https://gitlab.com/simulant/community/">Simulant Engine</a> instead
    of official one as these contains various community improvements and
  fixes.</li>
  <li>In <strong>Code::Blocks</strong>, an issue when generating
    <strong>Romdisk</strong> from projects with spaces in their name has been
    fixed.</li>
  <li><strong>MakeDisc</strong>: An little cosmetic problem has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Various fixes for <strong>Windows 10+</strong> (mainly related to
  UAC).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Updated</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for SuperH</strong> and
    <strong>AICA</strong> is now <span class="font-fixed">4.7.4</span>, as this
    version includes several fixes for <span class="font-fixed">sh-elf</span>
    target.</li>
  <li><strong>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for Win32</strong> is now <span
    class="font-fixed">8.2.0</span>.</li>
  <li><strong>GNU Debugger (GDB) for SuperH</strong> is now <span
    class="font-fixed">8.3.1</span>.</li>
  <li><strong>DreamSDK Manager</strong> was updated to display more useful
    information like repositories versions or environment information.</li>

</ul>

<h2>R2 — 2019-03-03</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Full <strong>Code::Blocks</strong> <span class="font-fixed">17.12</span>
    integration!</li>
  <li><strong>GNU Debugger (GDB) for SuperH</strong> is now the <span
    class="font-fixed">8.2</span> release.</li>
  <li><strong>DreamSDK Runner</strong> is now part of the package. This
    application allows executions of instructions directly in the <strong>MSYS
    Shell</strong> but from the standard <strong>Microsoft Windows
    Prompt</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>DreamSDK Shell</strong> has been simplified: it's now a
    <strong>MSYS Shell</strong> shortcut only (previous role is now handled by
    <strong>DreamSDK Runner</strong>).</li>
