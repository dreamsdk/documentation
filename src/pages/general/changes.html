<h1>Changes Log</h1>

<p>This section describes all releases and notable changes made to the DreamSDK
environment.</p>

<h2>R3 — 2023-09-DD</h2>

<h3>Added</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Experimental <strong>Ruby</strong> support! This feature uses <a href="https://mruby.org/" target="_blank">mruby</a> (lightweight, embeddable Ruby). This feature is handled in <strong>DreamSDK Manager</strong> through the Ruby tab.</li>

<li>Some useful links were added in the <strong>Windows Start</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Support of <strong>CDFS</strong> images in <strong>Code::Blocks</strong>:
    You have now the possibility to simulate a virtual <strong>CD-ROM</strong>
    through an <strong>ISO</strong> file, when selecting the appropriate option
    when creating a project in <strong>Code::Blocks</strong>.</li>
  <li>Support for <span class="font-fixed">libkosfat/navi</span> addon libraries.</li>
  <li>You have now the possibility to manage <strong>Code::Blocks</strong> in <strong>DreamSDK Manager</strong>. </li>
  <li>Support for <strong>Windows Terminal</strong> (if available).</li>
  <li>The USB baud rates for <strong>Dreamcast Tool Serial</strong> are now supported.</li>
	<li>Additional tools (e.g., <span class="font-fixed">curl</span>) and libraries (e.g., <span class="font-fixed">libelf</span>) are now available.</li>
<li>This <strong>CHANGELOG</strong> file to hopefully serve as an evolving
    example of a standardized open source project
  <strong>CHANGELOG</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Improved</h3>
<ul>
  <li>An offline version of <strong>KallistiOS</strong>, <strong>KallistiOS
    Ports</strong> and <strong>Dreamcast Tool</strong> are now integrated in
    the package. But it's strongly recommanded to use the online
  repositories!</li>
  <li>Better handling of prerequisites: <strong>Git</strong>,
    <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Subversion Client (SVN)</strong> are
    not mandatory in all the cases, this depends now of your choice.
    <strong>Git</strong> is mandatory only if you use online repositories,
    <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Subversion Client</strong> are always
    optional but preferred if you have the possibility to install these.</li>
  <li>When installing <strong>Code::Blocks</strong>, the process of updating
    user's configuration files is better. Now the <strong>Setup</strong>
    process detects all usable configuration files and patch them if
  possible.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>DreamSDK Manager</strong> tool, URL for the
    <strong>Git</strong> repositories may be changed.</li>
  <li>Better support for <strong>ARP</strong> (creation of the tool
    <strong>FastARP</strong>). It uses the classic <span
    class="font-fixed">arp</span> command in <strong>Windows XP</strong> and
    <span class="font-fixed">netsh</span> in modern
  <strong>Windows</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>MakeDisc</strong>: The <span class="font-fixed">bootstrap</span> parameter is now optional. It will try to detect the <span class="font-fixed">IP.BIN</span> from the current directory or directly in
    the directory where the <span class="font-fixed">1ST_READ.BIN</span> file
    is located.</li>
  <li>It's now possible to select the toolchains you want to use directly from the DreamSDK Manager instead of making your choice in the Setup. You have the possibility to choose between <strong>Legacy</strong>, <strong>Old Stable</strong> and <strong>Stable</strong> toolchains.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The installation of <strong>GNU Debugger (GDB) for SuperH</strong> is
    better; and <strong>Python</strong> extensions may be enabled/disabled on
    user request (previously, <strong>GDB for SuperH</strong> was linked to <strong>Python 2.7</strong> only).</li>
  <li>Removing some outdated packages provided by MSYS and replacing them with standalone packages:
	  <ol><li><strong>GNU Awk</strong>: From <span class="font-fixed">3.1.7</span> to <span class="font-fixed">4.0.1</span> (provided <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sizious/msys-gawk">here</a>)</li> 
		  <li><strong>MinTTY</strong>: From <span class="font-fixed">1.0.3</span> to <span class="font-fixed">3.5.0</span> (using <a target="_blank" href="https://mintty.github.io/">official MinTTY</a> source)</li>
        <li><strong>Wget</strong>: From <span class="font-fixed">1.12</span> to <span class="font-fixed">1.19.4</span> (provided by <a target="_blank" href="https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/">Jernej Simoncic</a>)</li>
	      
    </ol>
  </li>
	<li>The COM ports list used for <strong>Dreamcast Tool Serial</strong> is now dynamic and not hardcoded anymore.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In <strong>Code::Blocks</strong>, an issue when generating
    <strong>Romdisk</strong> from projects with spaces in their name has been
    fixed.</li>
  <li><strong>MakeDisc</strong>: An little cosmetic problem has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Tons of various fixes, including specific things for <strong>Windows 10+</strong> (mainly related to
  UAC).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Updated</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>MinTTY</strong> is now the default shell (you can still use Windows Prompt or Windows Terminal).&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for SuperH</strong> and <strong>AICA (ARM)</strong> is now <span class="font-fixed">4.7.4</span> (<strong>Legacy</strong>), <span class="font-fixed">9.5.0</span> for SuperH and <span class="font-fixed">8.5.0</span> for ARM (<strong>Old Stable</strong>) and <span class="font-fixed">13.2.0</span> for SuperH (<strong>Stable</strong>). <strong>Stable</strong> is the toolchain selected by default, but this one requires a modern OS (if you are on Windows XP, you can select <strong>Old Stable</strong> at maximum).</li>
<li><strong>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for Win32</strong> is now <span
    class="font-fixed">9.2.0</span>.</li>
  <li><strong>GNU Debugger (GDB) for SuperH</strong> is now <span
    class="font-fixed">10.2</span>.</li>
  <li><strong>DreamSDK Manager</strong> was updated to display more useful
    information like repositories versions or environment information.</li>
  <li>The help file was updated to reflect all the changes of this release.</li>
  <li>The JPEG library (<span
    class="font-fixed">libjpeg</span>) is now <span
    class="font-fixed">9d</span>.</li>
  <li>The PNG library (<span class="font-fixed">libpng</span>) is now <span class="font-fixed">1.6.37</span>.</li>
  <li>Some optional tools before are now mandatory and installed by default (e.g., <span class="font-fixed">img4dc</span>).</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>Removed</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>IPCreate</strong> tool was removed, as the standard KallistiOS repository
  contains now the modernized <strong>IP creator</strong> (<span class="font-fixed">makeip</span>) tool.</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>Known Bugs</h3>
	
<ul><li>Sometimes the <span class="font-fixed">CTRL+C</span> command is not working properly (no effect instead of killing the current process). This isn't really known why this happens, it looks like this issue is in the original MSYS tool as well.</li></ul>
	
<h2>R2 — 2019-03-03</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Full <strong>Code::Blocks</strong> <span class="font-fixed">17.12</span>
    integration!</li>
  <li><strong>GNU Debugger (GDB) for SuperH</strong> is now the <span
    class="font-fixed">8.2</span> release.</li>
  <li><strong>DreamSDK Runner</strong> is now part of the package. This
    application allows executions of instructions directly in the <strong>MSYS
    Shell</strong> but from the standard <strong>Microsoft Windows
    Prompt</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>DreamSDK Shell</strong> has been simplified: it's now a
    <strong>MSYS Shell</strong> shortcut only (previous role is now handled by
    <strong>DreamSDK Runner</strong>).</li>
  <li><strong>DreamSDK Manager</strong> was completely redesigned.</li>
  <li>A lot of additional tools have been included.</li>
  <li>Help system update.</li>
  <li>Lot of bugs fixes and various improvements.</li>
</ul>
