<h1>DreamSDK Overview</h1>

<p><strong>DreamSDK is a modern, ready-to-use environment for Sega Dreamcast
development, designed for the Microsoft Windows platform!</strong></p>

<p>It's a big, self-contained package embedding all needed software to freely
develop for the Sega Dreamcast system on Windows. This package is built on
open-source components so it doesn't contains any copyrighted software. See <a
href="licenses.html">the license section</a> for more information.</p>

<p>It was specially made for beginners but it can be of course used by
everyone!</p>

<p>In clear, DreamSDK provides you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An UNIX® like environment;</li>
  <li>3 prebuilt toolchains;</li>
  <li>Some side utilities in order to manage and exploit the power of that
    environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>To use DreamSDK, you have 2 options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Use the provided shell</strong>, in case you are confortable with
    the <a href="../shell/index.html">command-line interface</a>. This is the
    traditional way to develop;</li>
  <li><strong>Use an IDE</strong>. At this time of writing, only Code::Blocks
17.12 or 20.03 are supported. <a href="../ide/index.html">This will explained later
    in the document</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The programming languages used for Sega Dreamcast development are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>C / C++</strong></li>
  <li>Objective C / Objective C++ (not so used)</li>
  <li>Assembly (if you feel capable of learning Hitachi SH-4 assembly!)</li>
  <li><a href="requirements.html#ruby">Ruby</a> (experimental)</li>
</ul>

<p>All the sub-sections below describes in details the environment
composition:</p>

<h2><a name="arch">Architecture summary</a></h2>

<p>As described in the introduction, <strong>DreamSDK is a package which is
built upon a lot of various components</strong>.</p>

<p>The schema below describes the architecture of the whole environment:</p>

<div class="schema">
<img src="../../img/general/overview.gif"> </div>

<p>Each layer represent a middleware used in the package:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The foundation is MinGW/MSYS, and the DreamSDK Shell is a simplified
    launcher to access to it.</li>
  <li>Then comes the 3 toolchains: one for the CPU of the Dreamcast (i.e.
    SuperH), one for the audio chip (i.e. AICA) and the standard Win32
    toolchain in order to build utilities.</li>
  <li>This layer is KallistiOS library itself and related side-projects, i.e.
    Dreamcast Tool and KallistiOS Ports.</li>
  <li>On the top of all this stack, the DreamSDK Manager is the tool
    responsible of the management of all these components.</li>
</ol>

<p>To learn more on all these components, please continue reading this
document!</p>

<h2><a name="mingw">MinGW/MSYS</a></h2>
<div class="schema"><img src="../../img/general/mingw.png"> </div>

<p>As you might know, Windows provides the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> (or
<span class="font-fixed">cmd</span>) environment. This shell is not enough
powerful to do Dreamcast development so that's why DreamSDK provides an
additional UNIX® environment.</p>

<p>That UNIX® like environment is provided by <a href="https://mingw.osdn.io/"
target="_blank">MinGW/MSYS</a>. Basically this is the DreamSDK foundation.
Everything is built upon this platform.</p>

<h2><a name="shell">DreamSDK Shell</a></h2>

<p><a href="../shell/index.html">DreamSDK Shell</a> is a component built on the
top of <strong>MSYS</strong>. Basically, this is the main program of this
environment, as it will let you use the DreamSDK package itself through that
shell.</p>

<p>This Shell shouldn't have to be confused with the standard <strong>Command
Prompt</strong> (or <span class="font-fixed">cmd</span>)!</p>

<h2><a name="tool">Toolchains</a></h2>

<p>The toolchains are basically the set of the tools needed to produces your
programs, i.e. compiling programs and debugging them. In our case, these
toolchains are used to compile and build binary code targeting the Sega
Dreamcast.</p>

<p>3 toolchains are provided by the DreamSDK environment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For the <strong>SuperH CPU</strong> processor (<span
    class="font-fixed">sh-elf</span>), the main processor (CPU) of the Sega
    Dreamcast;</li>
  <li>For the <strong>Yamaha AICA</strong> processor (<span
    class="font-fixed">arm-eabi</span>), the sound processor. You don't have to
    use it directly, as this toolchain is needed only to compile the sound
    driver included in KallistiOS only (see below).</li>
  <li>The last one is the original <strong>Win32</strong> toolchain (<span
    class="font-fixed">mingw32</span>) provided by MinGW/MSYS, this allow you
    to produces Windows binaries, e.g. compiling KallistiOS utilities like
    <span class="font-fixed">vqenc</span>, <span
    class="font-fixed">scramble</span>, <span
    class="font-fixed">dc-tool</span>... But, you have the possibility to
    develop pure Windows binaries as well for other purposes if you need
  to.</li>
</ul>

<p>For your information, all the toolchains are packages composed by several
projects:<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/"
target="_blank"></a></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/"
    target="_blank">Binutils</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_blank">GNU Compiler
    Collection</a> (GCC)</li>
  <li><a href="http://sourceware.org/newlib/" target="_blank">Newlib</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/" target="_blank">GNU
    Debugger</a> (GDB)</li>
</ul>

<p>These components are already prebuilt and installed with the DreamSDK
environment, so you don't have to worry about that.</p>

<p><strong>All of these toolchains expect C/C++ source codes</strong>, or
Objective C/Objective C++ if you really want to use that language. <a
href="requirements.html#ruby">Ruby is experimental and uses mruby
implementation</a>, so it isn't interpreted directly by the toolchains.</p>

<h2><a name="kos">KallistiOS</a></h2>

<p><strong>KallistiOS provides you a ready-to-use software library to interact
with the Sega Dreamcast hardware</strong>. This facilitates a lot the
development, instead of writing low-level code to access the Sega Dreamcast
hardware: everything is already done by this library.</p>

<p>That's why DreamSDK uses <a
href="http://cadcdev.sourceforge.net/softprj/kos/"
target="_blank">KallistiOS</a> (<span class="font-fixed">KOS)</span>, which is
the best option today for Sega Dreamcast development. By the way, it has been
used to produce multiple commercial quality games for sale, like <strong>Feet
of Fury</strong>, <strong>Maqiupai</strong>, <strong>Inhabitants</strong>,
<strong>Cool Herders</strong>, <strong>Dynamite Dreams</strong> and many more.
DreamSDK respects all the standard <span class="font-fixed">KOS</span>
prerequisites and requirements, that means this environment is 100% compliant
with KallistiOS.</p>

<div class="schema">
<img src="../../img/general/kallistios-yuki.gif"> </div>

<p><strong>In clear:</strong> When you do Dreamcast development, you'll use the
KallistiOS library to interact with your Dreamcast. <a
href="http://gamedev.allusion.net/softprj/kos/" target="_blank">So you should
start learn KallistiOS API now!</a></p>

<h3><a name="kosports">KallistiOS Ports</a></h3>

<p>KallistiOS Ports are ports collection made by the KallistiOS team. Ports are
additional libraries used to extend the features of KallistiOS, like e.g.
adding support for <span class="font-fixed">PNG</span>, <span
class="font-fixed">JPEG</span> or <span class="font-fixed">SDL</span> to your
program.</p>

<h3><a name="dctool">Dreamcast Tool</a></h3>

<p>Dreamcast Tool, or <span class="font-fixed">dc-tool</span>, is the tool used
to send your programs to the Sega Dreamcast in order to execute and debug
them.</p>

<p>This program is split in two parts, <span class="font-fixed">dcload</span>
for the server part (executed on the Sega Dreamcast) and <span
class="font-fixed">dc-tool</span> for the client part (executed from your
computer).</p>

<p>Depending of your connection kind, you have to use the correct program
version:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you own the <strong>Serial</strong> cable (aka the Coders Cable), the
    version to use is <span class="font-fixed">dcload-serial</span>;</li>
  <li>If you have the luck owning an expensive <strong>Broadband
    Adapter</strong> or even the <strong>LAN Adapter</strong>, which are
    Ethernet cards for the Sega Dreamcast, you will have to use the <span
    class="font-fixed">dcload-ip</span> version.</li>
</ul>

<p>This component is disabled by default, as you have the possibility to
execute your programs directly through a Dreamcast emulator, i.e. using <span
class="font-fixed">Redream</span>, <span class="font-fixed">nullDC</span>,
<span class="font-fixed">Demul</span>, <span class="font-fixed">Makaron</span>,
etc. Please note, this possibility isn't supported in DreamSDK at least for
now.</p>

<h3><a name="managekos">Managing KallistiOS with DreamSDK environment</a></h3>

<p>Instead of the majority of previous released packages of this kind (e.g.
<span class="font-fixed">dcfreedev</span>  with that really out-dated <span
class="font-fixed">GCC 3.4.6</span> , <span class="font-fixed">DC Dev
Environment</span> (DDE), <span class="font-fixed">Code::Blocks DC
Development</span>...), <strong>DreamSDK includes the prebuilt
toolchains</strong> <strong>but not the prebuilt KallistiOS library
itself</strong>. KallistiOS building process is handled by the <a
href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK Manager</a> application.</p>

<p>This is the reason why DreamSDK do additional steps when installing it:
<span class="font-fixed">KOS</span> is compiled automatically at the end of the
installation process. If you have cancelled the process or the process has
failed, just fire-up <a href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK Manager</a> again
and that application will (re)install <span class="font-fixed">KOS</span> if
needed.</p>

<h3><a name="kosalt">Alternatives to KallistiOS</a></h3>

<p>As you saw, <strong>DreamSDK uses KallistiOS</strong>, as this software
library is the most advanced library for Sega Dreamcast development. </p>

<p>The other alternative to <span class="font-fixed">KOS</span> is <a
target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/ihi/libronin">Libronin</a>. This
software library was used for making <a href="http://mc.pp.se/dc/dreamsnes/"
target="_blank">DreamSNES</a>. It should work under DreamSDK, even if this
scenario was not tested.</p>

<p>You are free to use other libraries if you want, but KOS is a great choice
if you are new to Dreamcast development.</p>

<h2><a name="mgr">DreamSDK Manager</a></h2>

<p><a href="../manager/index.html">DreamSDK Manager</a> is the application
which handle everything of the DreamSDK environment. Basically this application
was made to update KallistiOS but it can also handle KallistiOS Ports even
Dreamcast Tool configuration.</p>
