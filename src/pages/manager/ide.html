<H1>IDE &mdash; Integrated Development Environment</H1>

<p>The IDE tab was made to manage the integration of the DreamSDK package with your favorite IDE, and in case of you didn't choose to do so within DreamSDK Setup. Only Code::Blocks is supported yet for historical reasons but this could change in the future.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
<img src="../../img/manager/ide.png" alt="IDE Tab"
title="IDE Tab"></div>

<p>In this tab, you will be able to view the current statut of the integration, install, reinstall or uninstall the integration of DreamSDK in the IDE of your choice.</p>
	
<h2>Code::Blocks</h2>
	
<p><a href="http://codeblocks.org" target="_blank">Code::Blocks is an open source IDE</a>. The integration is fully completed for this IDE. <a href="../ide/index.html">You may learn more here</a>.</p>
	
<p>Currently, 2 versions of Code::Blocks are supported:</p>
	
<ul>
	<li><strong>17.12</strong> (available in 32-bit only)</li>
	<li><strong>20.03</strong> (available on both 32-bit and 64-bit)</li>
</ul>
	
<p>As the DreamSDK integration for Code::Blocks is installing a completely brand new C::B package, i.e., new binaries that were built by the DreamSDK Team, only these 2 official versions are supported yet. This could change in the future if the required changes in the Code::Blocks codebase are accepted by the C::B Team.</p>
	
<p>To have a working environment for DreamSDK in Code::Blocks, you mean to startup at least one time C::B on the session you want to enable the integration, or you just have to click on the <span class="font-fixed">Initialize&hellip;</span> button. After installing the integration, by clicking <span class="font-fixed">Install&hellip;</span> or <span class="font-fixed">Reinstall&hellip;</span>, the session username will be displayed in the <span class="font-fixed">Code::Blocks for DreamSDK Enabled Users</span> box.</p>
	
<p>All features are supported, i.e., running and debugging your program. <a href="../ide/index.html">Everything is described here</a>.</p>		
<p>You can restore the real, official Code::Blocks installation by clicking the <span class="font-fixed">Uninstall&hellip;</span> button.</p>
