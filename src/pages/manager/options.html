<h1>Options</h1>

<p>The Options tab display all the repositories URL used by DreamSDK Manager to
download the KallistiOS components, <a href="../shell/terminal.html">plus the
Terminal choice</a>, between the Windows Prompt or MinTTY for the DreamSDK
Shell.</p>

<div class="screenshot">

title="Options Tab"></div>

<p>You have also the possibility to run the original <span
class="font-fixed">MinGW Installation Manager</span>, if you want to add some
features to the MinGW/MSYS environment used by your DreamSDK environment.
Please also note, all the required MinGW/MSYS packages for the DreamSDK
environment are already installed. Another possibility is to reset to their
default values the Terminal choice and all the options in the Dreamcast Tool
tab, but this will not erase your custom IP or MAC addresses.</p>

<p>If you already have installed KallistiOS, then the
URL fields will be grayed out, because the repositories already exists. If you
want to choose another repositories source, you will need to click on the <font class="font-fixed">Reset&hellip;</font> button in front of each repository fields. After that,
the URL fields will be unlocked. You will just need to <a
href="kos.html">Update KallistiOS</a> and everything will be set up after that
operation.</p>
	
<p>Another option is to use the offline packages included in DreamSDK. This option is not really recommanded but could be useful in some cases, e.g., if you don't have access to Internet on your development computer. You will need to click on the <span class="font-fixed">Offline&hellip;</span> button to install the corresponding offline package. After that, you will need to <a
href="kos.html">Update KallistiOS</a> and you are good to go. Please note, in that mode, everytime you update KallistiOS, this will take time, more time that using the online repositories.</p>
